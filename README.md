# Juju Lens [![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/katharostech/juju-lens/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/katharostech/juju-lens)

Juju Lens is a new web GUI for the [Juju] orchestration tool with a beautiful interface and support for multiple controllers. Juju Lens is under heavy development, but is usable right now ( see the Getting Started section below ). If you have any ideas or feedback let us know on the [Juju Forum][jf] by creating a topic in the [UX & Design category][jf]. You can also open a GitHub issue.

## Try The Desktop App!

Juju Lens has a new desktop application featuring instant, one-click SSH support. Read the announcement on the [Juju Forum](https://discourse.juju.is/t/juju-lens-v0-1-0-new-desktop-application-with-ssh-support/3613?u=zicklag) or check out our [releases](https://github.com/katharostech/juju-lens/releases) to download and try it out!

## Getting Started

To get started, you don’t need to install anything! ( assuming you already have a Juju controller to connect to. ) Just go to the [Juju Lens App][juju_lens], add one or more controllers, and you’re all set. All data is stored locally in your browser, so if you access the Lens from a different browser you will have to re-add your controllers.

Juju Lens will connect to your controller and display the number of machines, models, applications, and units in the controller list. Then click on the models tab:
